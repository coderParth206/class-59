        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I love swimming but I can not do it much anymore because of coronavirus. I used to be on the swim team for pjcc. It took me 2 years to pass every level before I got there. I really enjoy swimming and I have developed an interest for it as i learned swimming. Now it is one of my favorite sports. I hope after the virus I can continue to swim in swim team.</p>

    <section id="Work">
        <h1>Work</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Well... I technically used to "work" at pjcc because I used to go to the swim team over there. But I do not really work anywhere as I am still learning and I am in school. But now, as I said earlier, I can not go to swim team right now because of the coronavirus. But, I have heard that it is starting soon! </p>

    <section id="inspiration">
        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <div class="inspiration"></div>
        <p> I do not really have an inspiration as I just started to like swimming as I learned it. But I just like swimming and it is my hobby. I do not really watch sports so I do not know many people that play them. That is why I have no inspiration that made me wanting to do swimming.

    <section id="Where">
        <h1> Where I go </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> I go to the pjcc swim team. That is where I have been going for years. In fact, I went there for 2 years before going into swim team. I only got to be in swim team for a couple of months before corona struck and pjcc closed down for a while.

        <section id="contact">
        <h1> Contact </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> I only have contact with my parents and friends. I sometimes use discord to be with my friends and I also sometimes use whatsapp in order to communicate with family members. I do not have an American phone number so I can not use messages.
